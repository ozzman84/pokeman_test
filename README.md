This tech challenge is tech agnostic. Our stack is in Ruby on Rails and Typescript/React, but you are welcome to use whatever tools you are most familiar with. This portion should take no more than 1 hour of your time.

During the onsite portion, you will continue to build off what you have built here. Additionally, the onsite will consist of approximately 1 hour of individual work time and another hour will be used to pair with another engineer on our team. This take home portion and the onsite portion is open book and you will be allowed to access any resources you may need including Stack Overflow, documentation, past repos, etc.

Project Requirements:

- Create a database with a single table containing the 151 Pokemon from Bulbasaur to Mew using info from the API provided: https://pokeapi.co/.

- The Pokemon table should have at least the following columns: id, name, height, weight, abilities, forms, and moves.

- Create an endpoint called index.

- Confirm this works by running your web server locally. When a user visits the `http://your_web_server:port/index` endpoint, they should see the following in the browser:
    - Shows all pokemon in a bulleted list in numerical order by default
    - Has a button that if clicked will sort the Pokemon in alphabetical order

Some sample HTML:
<html>
	<body>
		<h1>Pokemon</h1>
			<ul>
  				<li>bulbasaur</li>
				<li>ivysaur</li>
			</ul>
	</body>
</html>

If you have any questions, please let us know.

Additionally, we ask that you take the time to familiarize yourself with whatever tech stack you choose to work with prior to coming to the onsite. Once your are done completing the above requirements, you should be set!
